# 🧠 Introduction to Algorithms

## 1. What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations.

> **Formula**: Input + Algorithm = Output

### Characteristics of a Good Algorithm:

1.  **Well-Defined**: Each step must be clear and unambiguous.
2.  **Finite**: It must terminate after a finite number of steps.
3.  **Effective**: Steps should be basic enough to be carried out.
4.  **Language Independent**: Logic should be applicable in any language (Java, C++, Python).

## 2. Pseudocode & Flowcharts

Before writing code, we design it.

- **Pseudocode**: Plain English representation of code logic.
  ```text
  IF student_grade >= 50
      PRINT "Passed"
  ELSE
      PRINT "Failed"
  ```
- **Flowchart**: Diagrammatic representation (Diamonds for decisions, Rectangles for processes).

## 3. Types of Algorithms

1.  **Brute Force**: Trying every possible solution (e.g., checking every number to see if it's a factor).
2.  **Recursive**: Algorithm calls itself with smaller inputs.
3.  **Greedy**: Making the locally optimal choice at each step.
4.  **Divide and Conquer**: Breaking problem into sub-problems (e.g., Merge Sort).
5.  **Dynamic Programming**: Storing results of sub-problems to avoid re-computation.

## 4. Problem Solving Steps

1.  **Understand** the problem (Constraints, Input Format).
2.  **Analyze** example cases (Edge cases).
3.  **Design** an approach (Pseudocode).
4.  **Implement** (Coding).
5.  **Optimize** (Refining Time/Space complexity).
